<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>


<h2>Day 0: May 26, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: I created my git repository that will house all my progress. I have adjusted the rules slightly to avoid doing an hour a day as this
is a challenge give my employment and school status. I am still commited though. I am currently learning the "Responsive Web Design" course through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">freecodecamp</a>
I have already learned basic HTML and HTML5 as I have included a hyperlink in this log. (I learned how to throught this course ;3) I havge also learned basic CSS. I am moving on
to "Applied Visual Design" now.

<h2>Day 1: May 27, Thursday</h2>
Today's Progress: I have updated my twitter to better document my progress. Also, included more information on my git. Today I learned <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/create-visual-balance-using-the-text-align-property">Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property</a> I did not have a lot of time today but I will be pushing more tomorrow. I start my new schedule at work this weekend which will give me more time to code!!


<h2>Day 2: May 28, Friday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: I have learned 26 lessons in one day. I think I pushed like I said ha. I like how it is finally explaining more in depth how websites get their format. I have become so blinded when I go to a website that I expect a certain format. Learning how much time it actually takes to form website structure is quite eye opnening. I took a seak peek at the up coming lessons and I am even more excited. More specifically the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/animate-elements-continually-using-an-infinite-animation-count">Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count</a>. This one in particular looks fun.


<h2>Day 3: May 29, Saturday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: I was only able to complete 1 lesson today. I had a whole bunch of plans going on including my schedule change. I know it is just excuses but I will get on it on my days off that are coming up.


<h2>Day 4: May 30, Sunday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: Completed lessons 27-30. Had a hectic day at work and was able to squeeze some time in. I am glad I have started to get into the cool visual effects now. This will be a strong motivator over my weekend to complete this section finally.


<h2>Day 5: May 31, Monday</h2>
Today's Progress: Completed lessons 30-52 today. The animation is still a little confusing to me so I will do some more reasearch on my spare time. Going to tackle Applied Accessability tomorrow. I will be trying to start a project idea soon for a website I had in mind. Still working out the layout but I want to make it special.


<h2>Day 6: June 1, Tuesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Completed lessons 1-11 on Applied Accessability. I am surprised to this side of development. I never knew there was accessability formatting for webpages because I do not need to use them. The ammount of consideration web pages can have for people with all kinds of disabilities is amazing!


<h2>Day 7: June 2, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Finished Applied accessability. I am in love with how much detail is involved with web design. You need to think about all types of users and their everyday struggles when creating a website. This way you can cater to everyone. I love this.


<h2>Day 8: June 3, Thursday</h2>
Today's Progress: Focused only on Responsive Web Design principles today. I wanted to understand them without overloading myself. I have obviously life to cater to but I still was able to complete this section. This section was short but important as formatting is important.


<h2>Day 9: June 4, Friday</h2>
Today's Progress: Today was the first day of my new schedule and I was only able to complete 1-9 on CSS FlexBox. I am starting to realize the multitude of formatting options CSS offers. I am not very artistic but with the help of CSS this is another way I can express my more creative side.


<h2>Day 10: June 5, Saturday</h2>
Today's Progress: Finished CSS FlexBox. Now I see why people get confused when it comes to positioning in CSS &#129315. Although, I myself am starting to get a little overwhelmed with all the options for creative approach myself but I am determined.


<h2>Day 11: June 6, Sunday</h2>
Today's Progress: Started CSS grid. This section is coming naturally to me. I am fond of the structure of rows and columns so this section, so far, is probably my favorite.


<h2>Day 12: June 7, Monday</h2>
Today's Progress: Yeah, CSS Grid is my favorite so far. I picked up on this section pretty quickly. Coming from understanding two-dimentional (or more) arrays in C++ this section was super easy to apply the same logic.


<h2>Day 13: June 8, Tuesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Started the tribute page project. Decided to make it on Nikola Tesla as he is a big insperation for me in my persuite for understanding computers and technology. 


<h2>Day 14: June 9, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Finished my first website!! This is so basic but I am proud of myself. I was able to look up information I either forgot or did not know and used the template website as a guide for the most part. Either way I am def rewarding myself tonight!


<h2>Day 15: June 10, Thursday</h2>
Today's Progress: I just started on my next webpage the survey form. So far this is more daunting than the tribute page because this requires more input than the last. I will get this!


<h2>Day 16: June 11, Friday</h2>
Today's Progress: Finished the survey form. After I got the format down, with some assistance from the example on freecodecamp, I was able to get it. I really feel like I want to come back and update these pages just to see my progress. For now though I will be moving on to the next challenge.


<h2>Day 17: June 12, Saturday</h2>
Today's Progress: Another slow day at work so I was able to nock out a good chunk off the product landing page. I spent forever trying to figure out how to center the row with the quality listing but I was able to figure it out....with the help of a few google searches. I will be finishing the formatting tomorrow and the bottom section as I need a little break from this.


<h2>Day 18: June 13, Sunday</h2>
Today's Progress: Super, and I mean super, busy day at work. The first half of the day was spent catching up because of vacations but we got it done. I was able to squeeze in the final section to the product landing page so just glad I am keeping a good pace. I really want to keep moving on but need to prove what I have learned. Not only to those following but to myself as if this is what I really want to do I need to get it done like I always do.


<h2>Day 19: June 14, Monday</h2>
Today's Progress: I started the tech documentation page today. This on by far is my most favored out of all the challenges. I find myself reading a bunch of these in my spare time so I find it exciting to contribute to one. 


<h2>Day 20: June 15, Tuesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Finished the tech documentation page. This is my favroite one by far. I felt like I actually knew what I was doing by looking up what I needed to and completing section after section so fast. This is what I am ment to do I just know it.


<h2>Day 21: June 16, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: Started and finished the portfolio page. It feels weird making a webpage about myself as I was scratching for things to inclued. I was taking the whole site crazy serious but it wasnt a real one so I needed to get it done. Glad with the result nonetheless.


<h2>Day 22: July 8, Thursday</h2>
Today's Progress: Took a little break to finish up some side projcets such as building my wife's computer, summer finals, converting my main system to linux and dealing with hurricane Elsa. In that amount of time I was able to complete ES6 on free code camp but it was so far inbetween I dont want to just include almost a month of just one module a day. I am getting back on track now so hopefully there will not be any more distractions.
