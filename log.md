<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>


<h2>Day 0: May 26, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: I created my git repository that will house all my progress. I have adjusted the rules slightly to avoid doing an hour a day as this
is a challenge give my employment and school status. I am still commited though. I am currently learning the "Responsive Web Design" course through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">freecodecamp</a>.
I have already learned basic HTML and HTML5 as I have included a hyperlink in this log. (I learned how to throught this course ;3) I havge also learned basic CSS. I am moving on
