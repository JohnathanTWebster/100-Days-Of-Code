<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>


<h2>Day 0: May 26, Wednesday</h2>
Today's Progress: I created my git repository that will house all my progress. I have adjusted the rules slightly to avoid doing an hour a day as this
is a challenge give my employment and school status. I am still commited though. I am currently learning the "Responsive Web Design" course through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">freecodecamp</a>
I have already learned basic HTML and HTML5 as I have included a hyperlink in this log. (I learned how to throught this course ;3) I havge also learned basic CSS. I am moving on
to "Applied Visual Design" now.

<h2>Day 1: May 27, Thursday</h2>
Today's Progress: I have updated my twitter to better document my progress. Also, included more information on my git. Today I learned <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/create-visual-balance-using-the-text-align-property">Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property</a> I did not have a lot of time today but I will be pushing more tomorrow. I start my new schedule at work this weekend which will give me more time to code!!


<h2>Day 2: May 28, Friday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: I have learned 26 lessons in one day. I think I pushed like I said ha. I like how it is finally explaining more in depth how websites get their format. I have become so blinded when I go to a website that I expect a certain format. Learning how much time it actually takes to form website structure is quite eye opnening. I took a seak peek at the up coming lessons and I am even more excited. More specifically the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/animate-elements-continually-using-an-infinite-animation-count">Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count</a>. This one in particular looks fun.



<h2>Day 3: May 29, Saturday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: I was only able to complete 1 lesson today. I had a whole bunch of plans going on including my schedule change. I know it is just excuses but I will get on it on my days off that are coming up.



<h2>Day 4: May 30, Sunday</h2>
Today's Prpgress: Completed lessons 27-30. Had a hectic day at work and was able to squeeze some time in. I am glad I have started to get into the cool visual effects now. This will be a strong motivator over my weekend to complete this section finally.


<h2>Day 5: May 31, Monday</h2>
Today's Progress: Completed lessons 30-52 today. The animation is still a little confusing to me so I will do some more reasearch on my spare time. Going to tackle Applied Accessability tomorrow. I will be trying to start a project idea soon for a website I had in mind. Still working out the layout but I want to make it special.
